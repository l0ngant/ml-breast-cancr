This is a machine learning exercise based on a simplified version of this dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)
The scope of this exercise was to train a classification model that, given some variables, could predict if the identified mass is bening (2 in the dataset) or malignant (4 in the dataset).
